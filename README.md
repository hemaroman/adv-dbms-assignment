The purpose of this proposal is to design and implement a distributed human resource (HR) database system for American College of Technology (ACT). The proposed system will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of HR operations by providing a centralized repository of HR data that multiple users across different locations can access.
The system will be designed to be scalable, high performance,secure and highly reliable.
